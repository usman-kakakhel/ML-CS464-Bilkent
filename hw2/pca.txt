PCA with cov method:
1. find mean of each row of data
2. subtract mean from each row of data
3. find cov of mean centered data
4. find eig_val, eig_Vec of cov

Dimension reduction:
1. select k<=d
2. sort eig_val, eig_vec based on eig_vals
3. select 1st k eig_vec columns
4. reduced = data (dot) selected columns

Reconstruction:
1. reconstructed = reduced (dot) (selected columns).T

PCA with SVD method:
1. u,s,vT = svd(A)
2. put diag(s) in matrix (Sigma) of size A

Dimension Reduction:
3. select k <= d
5. seelct k rows from vT
6. reduced = A (dot) (selected rows).T

Reconstruction
3. reconstruct = U (dot) Sigma (dot) vT
